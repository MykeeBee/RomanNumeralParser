# RomanNumeralParser

My good friend, [pjsdev](https://github.com/pjsdev), tasked me with writing a simple console app to take in a Roman Numeral string and return the integer value.
There is currently no check for valid Roman Numerals nor does it prompt the user to enter a string. These are possible additions in the future.
